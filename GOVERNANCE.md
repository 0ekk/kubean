# Kubean Project Governance

## User

Kubean community users, feel free to comment your usage information in **[Who is using Kubean](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues/910 "Who is Using Kubean")**.

The community welcomes any individuals, companies, and organizations to use, contribute to, report bugs, submit feature requests, and help each other.

We recommend using [Github Issues](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues "Github Issues") to track bugs and manage requests.

## Contributor

Every user is welcome to participate and contribute to the Kubean open-source community in a number of ways, including but not limited to the following:

1. Engage in lively discussions in [Github Issues](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/issues "Github Issues").
2. Submit code patches.
3. Translate, revise, add to, and improve the [documentation](https://kubean-io.github.io/kubean/ "Documentation");
4. Share experiences with the Kubean project and actively promote it.
5. Submit suggestions/criticisms.

Prominent contributors can be included in the Kubean project's [Maintainers List](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).
All contributors who have submitted PRs to Kubean will be permanently recorded in the [Contributors List](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean#thumbsup-contributors).

## Maintainer

Kubean Maintainers have write access to the [Kubean](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean).
They can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers
can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).  Maintainers collectively manage the project's
resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the Kubean project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.

The collective team of all Maintainers is known as the Maintainer Council, which
is the governing body for the project.

### Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

- commitment to the project:
  - participate in discussions, contributions, code and documentation reviews
      for 6 month or more,
  - perform reviews for 20 non-trivial pull requests,
  - contribute 20 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,
- ability to write quality code and/or documentation,
- ability to collaborate with the team,
- understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),
- understanding of the project's code base and coding and documentation style.

A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by sending a message to the
[bo.jiang@daocloud.io](bo.jiang@daocloud.io). A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers
approves the application.  Maintainers nominations will be evaluated without prejudice
to employer or demographics.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights,
and invited to the [xiao.zhang@daocloud.io](xiao.zhang@daocloud.io).

### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may resign at any time if they feel that they will not be able to
continue fulfilling their project duties.

Maintainers may also be removed after being inactive, failure to fulfill their
Maintainer responsibilities, violating the Code of Conduct, or other reasons.
Inactivity is defined as a period of very low or no activity in the project
for a year or more, with no definite schedule to return to full Maintainer
activity.

A Maintainer may be removed at any time by a 2/3 vote of the remaining maintainers.

Depending on the reason for removal, a Maintainer may be converted to Emeritus
status.  Emeritus Maintainers will still be consulted on some project matters,
and can be rapidly returned to Maintainer status if their availability changes.

## Core Technical Committee

The Kubean project is governed and directed by a Core Technical Committee (CTC), which is responsible for the development of the Kubean project.

The CTC has final authority over this project, which includes:

* Setting the technical direction
* Establishing project governance and processes (including this policy)
* Managing the contribution policy
* Overseeing the GitHub repository hosting
* Enforcing conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

The Core Technical Committee consists of Reviewers & Approvers, see **[OWNERS](https://github.com/kubean-io/kubean/blob/main/OWNERS "OWNERS")** for a list.
